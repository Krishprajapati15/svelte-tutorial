# Svelte Tutorial 🚀

Welcome to the **Svelte Tutorial** repository!  
This project serves as a hands-on guide to learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) by building and exploring a real-world codebase.  
Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your Svelte knowledge, this repo is packed with examples, structured code, and clear organization.

## 📦 Project Structure

Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

```
.
├── .svelte-kit/       # SvelteKit build artifacts (auto-generated)
├── src/               # Main source code
│   ├── app.css        # Global styles
│   ├── app.html       # Root HTML template
│   ├── lib/           # Shared libraries/assets (e.g., images)
│   └── routes/        # Application routes (pages, layouts, endpoints)
├── static/            # Static files (served at site root)
├── .gitignore         # Git ignore rules
├── package.json       # Project metadata and dependencies
├── svelte.config.js   # Svelte project configuration
└── README.md          # You are here!
```

### Key Folders

- `src/routes/`  
  - Page and layout components for the app.
  - Each subdirectory represents a route (e.g., `/about`, `/sverdle`, `/sverdle/how-to-play`).
  - Svelte files (`.svelte`) and route logic (`.js`/`.ts`) live here.

- `src/lib/images/`  
  - Contains images and icons used throughout the project.

- `.svelte-kit/`  
  - Auto-generated by SvelteKit during build; you typically don't edit this directly.

- `static/`  
  - Files here are served as-is (e.g., `favicon.png`, `robots.txt`).
